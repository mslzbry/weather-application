# weather-application

## Description:

For this project, I was instructed to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. My goal is to address the above points, along with proper deployment, and application and repo quality.

To start, I explored this weekâ€™s in-class activities and reviewed/built the starter html, css, and JavaScript on the points we learned throughout the week. The above was based around the conditionals/requirements provided in this week's module.

Moving beyond this, I then built out the html, css, and js scaffolding. Then, in js I homed in on connecting the third party APIs, along with dynamically updated html and css components. After this, I tested the site several times, searching for various cities, including non-cities (eg "aaa"), to find any edge cases.

My primary goals throughout the above processes include: when the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history; when the user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed; when the user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity; when the user, clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

Throughout this entire process, I added relevant comments in the code; these comments act as snippets of the general outline of the content herein.
